<p> Have you been searching for the perfect gym buddy, but you don’t know who to ask?<p>

<p> Are you switching majors, and you’d like mentorship advice from someone who has made the same transition? <p>

<p>Enter, HelpBay.<p>

<p>HelpBay as an application serves primarily as a platform for verified users from a worldwide audience to engage in reciprocal actions known as “favors”. These favors serve to foster camaraderie on a global level. To lower the barrier of entry, all “favors” done on the platform are free, and are done for an action of equivalent value for the participant. 

Implementation of this application would be primarily targeted towards university students. As the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed, university students globally are looking for ways to foster friendship and interact with those with compatible goals and interests.

Our verification process will consist of sending a photo of your student ID specified pose (ex. A thumbs up), that will be verified by our staff, alongside standard email verification. To further ensure quality control, users of the application will be rewarded stars if they receive a good rating when completing their favors, which can be seen by other users of the application, and used to make decisions about which users to interact with.<p>

<p>One such interaction that our app encourages is as follows:<p>
